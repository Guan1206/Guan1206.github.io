# About Me
I am a Ph.D. student at the Computer Science department in University of Liverpool, under the supervision of Dr. Shan Luo and Prof. Danushka Bollegala. Previously, I received my MSc in Big Data and High-Performance Computing at University of Liverpool. My research mainly focuses on robotic perception, especially multimodal perception, and crossmodal translation between vision and tactile sensing.

# About Me
<!-- I am a Ph.D. student at the Computer Science department in University of Liverpool, under the supervision of Dr. Shan Luo and Prof. Danushka Bollegala. Previously, I received my MSc in Big Data and High-Performance Computing at University of Liverpool. My research mainly focuses on robotic perception, especially multimodal perception, and crossmodal translation between vision and tactile sensing. -->
I am a lecturer in robotics at Bristol Robotics Laboratory, University of the West of England. My research mainly focuses on robotic perception, tactile sensing, and robot tactile intelligence with LLMs.

I was a research associate at University of York from 2024 to 2025. I received my PhD degree from University of Liverpool, under the supervision of Dr. Shan Luo and Prof. Danushka Bollegala.
